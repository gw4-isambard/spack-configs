# ISAMBARD Specific Configs
The directory cray can be symlinked in /etc/spack.  We may need to divide up the different systems we have on Isambard but for now concentrate on thunderx2 and A64fx.

Need to understand how Spack can handle different targets and whether we can point to different versions and locations.
